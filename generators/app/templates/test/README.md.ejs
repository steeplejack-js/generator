# Testing

This is where the automated tests for the application live.

## Unit

The unit tests test all of the functionality of the application. These are done against mocked instances and **NEVER**
against real services. This allows us to test things that may happen rarely, such as database failures.

## End-to-End (e2e)

The end-to-end tests test the journey from the initial call, to the persistence layer and the response. Typically, these
will not be as comprehensive as the unit tests - a random database failure is difficult to simulate reliably.

## Smoke

The smoke tests are performed to test whether a new deployment can be commissioned to the live instance. These are the
least rigorous of the tests, as these are idempotent and should never change the data in the persistence layer. See
